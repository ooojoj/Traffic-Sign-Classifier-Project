    "\n",
    "* The next bar charts illustrate a distribution of images across datasets. It is clear from the histograms that some classes are underrepresented. This might results in a lower performance of the ANN for these signs. Following the recommendation from [Traffic Sign Recognition with Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf), a fake images (jittered) should be added to a dataset. \n",

    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most of improvements were inspired from the [Traffic Sign Recognition with Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf) and from a classroom exercise with the LeNet implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conversion to grayscale - Not much improvement recorded. However, it seems that training time is shorter than for a 3-channels image. This can be useful if large datasets are used e.g. when jittered images are added. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Standardisation to between -1 and 1 - Easy to implement and worked very well. However, it is important to have a result as float, otherwise the effect is quite opposite; a bid drop in the accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Conversion to YUV and normalisation of Y channel - A noticeable improvement with respect to initial 89% but in the later stage of the project this technique was dismissed in favour of the global normalisation and standardisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Global normalisation - Implemented with use of cv2.equalizeHist(). This provided a significant boost to the training and validation accuracy. Very likely the increased contrast (see figure below) helps the network to extract more features.\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "* Additional data - The histograms of the original dataset indicated that the classes were not equally represented by the number of images. Also, the mentioned article suggested to add few additional augmented images per each original image. The suggested augmentations were: random translation by [-2:2] pixels, random rotation within [-15: +15] degrees and random scaling within [-10:10] %. Here is an example of an original image and an augmented image:\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "* The original dataset has 34799 images whereas the augmented dataset contains 208794 images. The augmentation introduced another significant boost, allowing to consistently achieving the validation accuracy above 96%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final pre-processing involves:\n",
    "Step 1: Global normalisation\n",
    "Step 2: Standardisation\n",
    "Step 3: Generate additional jittered images\n",

    "#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LeNet network, as suggested, was chosen as a base for my model. The mentioned paper suggested further modifications but once a dropout was added after each layer the model started to perform very well and focus was placed on tuning the hyperparameters and adding fake data.   \n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Adam Optimiser as a default optimiser performed very well. The Gradient Descent Optimizer was also tried few times but its performance was worse than Adam's. \n",
    "* The hyperparameters were adjust by trial and error. The final settings were Epochs=30, Batch=128, learning rate=0.0005, dropout probability 0.9 (10%), mu=0, sigma=0.1,\n",
    "* Training time was quite fast and took approximately just several minutes on the NVIDA GTX 980. However, making TensorFlow to work on a GPU required quite some time.    \n",
    "\n",
    "See code in Step 2:Train, Validate and Test the Model  (**Traffic_Sign_ClassifierFinal.ipynb**).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 100%\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 98.5%\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 96.6%\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "The adopted LeNet network from the classroom's handwriting exercise produced good initial results i.e. 89% hence it was used.\n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "A correct adoption in terms of layers sizes and selection of a correct sigma parameter. Once sigma was changed from 0.01 to 0.1 much better results were obtained.\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "The attempt to replicate the suggested architecture as in the [Traffic Sign Recognition with Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf) failed. Instead a dropout of 10% was introduced after each layer to address the overfitting. Different level of dropout was tried but 10% seem to work the best for my model. \n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "The batch size and epochs were set fixed for most of trials. The major tuning parameter was the learning rate. It was initially set to 0.001 but gradually it was reduced to 0.0008 and then to 0.0005.\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "It was noticed that the model was overfitting. To address this a dropout was added. The introduction of dropout was one of the major boosts to the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "The convolutional networks used in the LeNet network and the mentioned paper demonstrated very good performance in symbols recognition. And as stated in the paper they can work in real time on embedded systems makes them an excellent tool for autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
    " 96.6% out of 12630 images were predicted correctly which is strong enough evidence that model works well. However, 4410 images for a validation set seem to be not enough to accurately monitor training progres. Further work would increase this amount to approx. 20% of a training dataset size.\n",

    "\n",
    "The images were resized into 32x32 RGB px with use of cv2.resize(, , interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA). The interpolation can play significant role so it was chosen such way the imported images resemble the quality of images from the training set.\n",

    "The predictions for the speed limit 60km/h and 80 km/h and no vehicles signs contain also different speed limit signs, what suggested that network have no trouble in recognition of unique features of these signs; a white circle with a red border. Very likely because of this the no vehicles sign was misclassified as a speed limit 80km/h. A similar case is for the speed limit 80km/h sign, which was recognised as the speed limit 120km/h. However, one would expect a misclassification as different double digits speed limit rather than three digits. It is worth to highlight that prior this final run the network had not trouble to recognise all the signs correctly with almost 100% confidence. As the all hyperparameters were fixed the reason for this difference is very likely due to randomness of the generated additional images. \n",
